# MAPACHE's MEMORY

In this project we wanted to create a game that would be accessible to all kind of people, since old persons and kids. In today's the technology has had advance so much at the point that we all can access and use this recurses for the common good. 

## How to play?

You'll find a 'PLAY NOW' button and when you click it a countdown will start, the 'Ready?' word will announce you that the game is close to beggin. Some cards will appear and try to keep their position! cause in a few seconds they will be flipped and then, it's your turn to click them by pairs. Any time you find pairs, your timer will give you some seconds more, but if you click the wrong cards your time will give you less seconds so... hurry up!
